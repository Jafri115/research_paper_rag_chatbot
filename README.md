# RAG Chatbot for Research Papers

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot designed to answer questions based on a collection of research papers (PDFs). It uses LangChain for the RAG pipeline, Sentence-Transformers for embeddings, ChromaDB as the vector store, FastAPI for a backend API, and Streamlit for a user-friendly frontend.
